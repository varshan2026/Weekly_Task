# Practiced Flexbox & Media Queries in Image Gallery & Subscription Task! ðŸŽ‰

# Image Gallery & Subscription

Just completed a task using HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and Media Queries! ðŸŽ‰ This task helped me practice Flexbox again, allowing me to easily create a flexible and responsive layout with minimal code. Flexbox made it simple to align and distribute elements, ensuring a clean, organized design. I also used media queries to make sure the layout adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile. Excited to continue refining my web development skills! ðŸ’»âœ¨
